## Gravity Equations in Commercial Trade

This repository contains resources related to the study and application of gravity equations in commercial trade analysis. This is the final project for the course: Empirical Economics (grade: 28/30)

### Introduction

Gravity equations in trade, inspired by Newton's law of universal gravitation, are widely used in economics to model and analyze patterns of international trade. These equations posit that trade flows between two countries are proportional to the product of their economic sizes and inversely proportional to the distance between them.
